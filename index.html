            <p>Over the past ten years I’ve worked with some fantastic people to create and implement imaginative and lasting brand and design for other fantastic people. Currently, I’m working with Reason First. Beyond that, I prefer my coffee black, fiction over non-fiction and I love learning stuff. My favourite days are ones where I’m (sometimes reluctantly) doing something I never have before. Anything else you want to know? Just ask!</p>
