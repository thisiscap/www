# Welcome :wave:

This is the repo of my small online presence. Made using Jekyll but no longer hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), feel free to take a look around.

## Things I forget

Setup

- Pull repo
- `cd` to folder
- Run `bundle install` to install everything needed.

Keep up to date

- Follow setup
- Run `bundle update`.

Run locally

- Follow setup
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
- Go to `http://localhost:4000`

Deploy

- Follow setup
- Run `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Chuck the contents of `_site` up onto hosting


## To do
[x] - Remove Github pages and move to hosting
[x] - Update readme.md to use build
[x] - Update local branch (or remove)
[] - Remove webfonts from repo and add .gitignore
[] - Check lighthouse audit and action
[x] - Add fallback for no-js, show static listing, hide nav links
[] - Add comment to repo back in
[] - Make repo public again
