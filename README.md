# Welcome :wave:

This is the repo of my small online presence. Made using Jekyll, feel free to take a look around.

## Things I forget

### Setup

- Run `bundle install` to install everything needed.

### Keep up to date

### Run locally

- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --open-url --livereload`
- `http://localhost:4000` should open in your browser.

- Chuck the contents of `_site` up onto hosting.
